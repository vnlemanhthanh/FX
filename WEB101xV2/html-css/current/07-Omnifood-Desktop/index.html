    <h3>
      ## About Omnifood We are a technology company first, but with a major
      focus on consumer well-being through a healthy diet. Most people are very
      busy with their jobs, family and friends, and other important activities,
      which doesn't leave much time for cooking. This might lead to a poor diet
      and lasting health consequences. We want to solve this problem by using an
      AI-centric approach. Users can use our app to select their diet and foods
      they like and dislike, and our AI algorithm will create a custom and
      individual weekly meal plan. But we don't stop there. We partner with
      restaurants and other cooking partners to actually cook and deliver all
      meals from the generated meal plans, in selected cities. All this will be
      packed up in a monthly subscription, where users can choose between
      receiving one or two meals per day, every single day of the month.
